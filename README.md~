# GrainBoundarySimulation

This simulation represents a distribution of precipitates in a single grain boundary. 

This simulation was made following the next experimental details:
A grain boundary in Al-alloy
Al3Sc precipitates of sizes about 20nm (red).
Stress fields around the particle - 50nm, splitted into different zones (grey gradation).
As precipitates can lie not exactly in grain boundary plane, we can see in several cases only the stress fields from them (without the particles themselves).
